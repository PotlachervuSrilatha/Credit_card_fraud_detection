Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Fraud Detection model based on anonymized credit card transactions

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.


# Getting started

get the code from the repository

1. github: [PotlachervuSrilatha/Credit_card_fraud_detection (github.com)](https://github.com/PotlachervuSrilatha/Credit_card_fraud_detection)

2. download the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
   
 that will be used to train a transaction classifier. Unzip it and put the content (creditcard.csv) under main folder (Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)

3. install required python packages if previously not installed

4. Finally run on Jupyter Notebook and enjoy ðŸ˜‰

5. Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling orundersampling for improving results.
